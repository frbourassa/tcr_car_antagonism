    "# Steady-state solutions of the revised AKPR model for TCR/CAR antagonism\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a stand-alone implementation of the revised AKPR model for TCR/TCR antagonism and TCR/CAR antagonism. It can be used to explore various aspects of the steady-state solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Provided functions\n",
    "In addition to core solution functions, we provide the following user interface-level functions:\n",
    "- Function `steady_akpr_i_1ligand`: which evaluates the steady-state solution for one receptor type (either TCR or CAR, same function). This is needed to compute the CAR antigen alone or TCR antigen alone outputs used in the denominator of fold-changes $FC$. \n",
    "- Function `steady_akpr_i_2ligands`: to evaluate the steady-state solution for a binary mixture of TCR antigens, for TCR/TCR antagonism. \n",
    "- Function `steady_akpr_i_receptor_types`: to evaluate the steady-state solution (all $C^\\rho_n$, $n \\in [0, \\ldots, N^{\\rho}]$ complexes and the active inhibitory species $I^{\\rho}$) for a given choice of TCR and CAR antigen quantities, $L^T$ and $L^C$, and binding times $\\tau^T$ and $\\tau^C$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To compute antagonism $FC$ from these functions, compute the output for the agonist only, then compute the output for the mixture, and compute the ratio. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we provide a function to evaluate the model solutions on a range of conditions:\n",
    "- The function `compute_fc_tcr_car_curve` computes, for a given CAR antigen affinity and density, a matrix of TCR/CAR antagonism fold-changes for an array of TCR antigen quantities and binding times. \n",
    "\n",
    "The supplemental information of Kondo, Bourassa, Achar *et al*., *Cell*, 2025 contains all the mathematical details on the model and the solution methods. We provide the equations in the box below. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Antigen binding times $\\tau^\\rho$ and quantities $L^\\rho$\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is purely about the model, without relying on separate scripts and data files, so it is **not** 1) loading peptide EC50s and converting them to binding times, nor 2) loading APC surface molecule abundance data, computing the mean MHC and CAR antigen levels, and also computing the number of loaded MHCs with a given TCR antigen, based on the pulse concentration (for in vitro) or the response of the 4996 TCR (for p53). Here, we wanted to provide a simple notebook to explore the mathematical model without adding these extra layers of code and experimental details. \n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest examining the model behavior for typical parameter values based on the actual experimental calibrations used in the paper:\n",
    "- $\\tau^T$: TCR antigen binding times, typically $0.5 -- 10$ s\n",
    "- $\\tau^C$: CAR antigen binding times, typically $500$ s to reflect the fact that CARs have an affinity for their ligands 100-1000x larger than TCRs. \n",
    "- $L^T$: number of TCR antigens per APC, ranging anywhere between 1 and 1,000,000\n",
    "- $L^C$: number of CAR antigens per APC, typically around 100,000 -- 1,000,000"
